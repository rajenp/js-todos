# js-todos
Simple TODO application built using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS

You can plug remote todoserver with it (see TODOService for the endpoints) or it also works with local storage if available or fallbacks to JS page scope storage for the demo purpose. In  JS page scope storage TODOs are cleared after page refresh otherwise they are persisted until remote todoserver is restarted or localStorage is cleared. 

You can try it here (Uses localStorage): https://rawgit.com/rpatil26/js-todos/master/index.html
