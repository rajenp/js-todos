# js-todos
Simple TODO application built using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS

You can plug remote todoserver with it (see TODOService for the endpoints) or it also works with local page scope storage for the demo purpose. In local scope TODOs are cleared after page refresh.

You can try it here: https://rawgit.com/rpatil26/js-todos/master/index.html
